# Roadmap

In order to have a structure to follow or a general guide of the project, you will find in the next lines a roadmap of the project. This roadmap will give information about what are going to be the steps of the project development. Almost every point or step will be related to one [milestone](https://github.com/FernandoRoldan93/UrbanBike/milestones) of the project. You can find further information and a list of issues on each one of the milestone pages.

1. [Architecture definition](https://github.com/FernandoRoldan93/UrbanBike/milestone/2): As a first step we have to choose what architecture will have the application.

2. [Development of the different modules](https://github.com/FernandoRoldan93/UrbanBike/milestone/3): This step will be parallel to the other ones, the reason is that we can always add more modules or functionalities to the project. This also include the development of the different tests on each of the modules that requires it. But in any case this step will include, at least, the next parts:
  * Station class
  * City class
  * [External API reader](https://github.com/FernandoRoldan93/UrbanBike/milestone/5)
  * Data storage
  * Configuration module

3. [Continuous Integration](https://github.com/FernandoRoldan93/UrbanBike/milestone/8): Adding tools that will allow to check all the tests after every change on the system.

4. [Dockerize the project](https://github.com/FernandoRoldan93/UrbanBike/milestone/6): Compression of the system in containers that will allow to deploy it easily on any machine.

5. [Deploy](https://github.com/FernandoRoldan93/UrbanBike/milestone/7): Once we have the system in a container we can deploy it in any cloud provider of our choice.
