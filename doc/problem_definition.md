# Introduction
The main goal of this project is to give a cloud solution to one problem. In my case I will try to solve the problem of the city mobility, giving citizen relevant information about where can they find bikes for rental and make easier to move around the city.

# Solution
When we think on the city mobility based on bikes, we think on that bike stations that are everywhere, these stations are used by the users to store and These bikes are stored in bike stations, the main goal is to get the data from one API, process it and give it to the clients. To achieve this, the clients, will access to the application throw some APIs that will be declared in future contributions to the project. The data to be used can be accessed through this third party [API](http://api.citybik.es/v2/).
