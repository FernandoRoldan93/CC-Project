# CC-Project
This repository will be used to develop the final project for the subject cloud computing. Parallel to this project some self evaluation problem will be solved in their own repository that can be found [here](https://github.com/FernandoRoldan93/Ejercicios-CC)

# Introduction
The main goal of this project is to give a cloud solution to one problem. In my case I will try to solve the problem of the city mobility, giving citizen relevant information about where can they found bikes for rental and make easier to move around the city. These bikes are stored in bike stations, the main goal is to get the data from one api, process it and give it to the clients. The data to be used can be accessed through this third party [api](http://api.citybik.es/v2/).
