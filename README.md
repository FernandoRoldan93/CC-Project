## Architecture

After some study and research I have decided that the best Architecture for this project should be one based on microservices. There are several reasons for choose this Architecture, being all of them based on the advantages of this architecture. A further explanation can be found on the [document](./doc/architecture.md) created for that purpose.

## Tools

A lot of different tools will be used in the development of this project. These tools have to fit with the project in some way, this means that every tool should be choose with a specific purpose. In this section I will give a first look at these tools and the reasons to choose them. This section can be found on [this document](./doc/tools.md).
